# Download-Image-Viewer
First assignment for second Android POSA15 MOOC

As per course description:

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using Android Services by developing an app containing a main Activity that prompts the user for URLs of images to download concurrently via the DownloadImageService and then view via the DisplayImagesActivity. The DownloadImageService should use the Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html">IntentService</a> framework, which is covered in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9tx9sRmn48&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=39">this video</a>. Material presented in lectures during Week 1 and 2 of this class are also relevant to this assignment. </p>

# Skeleton Code

Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment1">here</a>. Pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.

Note that there are no automated unit tests for this assignment. Instead, you'll know the program is working when you can successfully download and view an image.  However, make sure your program works for both valid and invalid URL input.

# Concluding Remarks

This assignment is designed to further your understanding with programming Android Started Services and the IntentService framework in Java. Start early and come to Virtual Office Hours if you have questions or run into problems.  </p>
